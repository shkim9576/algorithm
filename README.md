This repository includes a various algorithm implementations.

## Uninformed Search Algorithm
Uninformed Search Algorithm use only information available in the problem definition.
Examples includes below. 
* Breadth First Search (BFS)
* Uniform Cost Search (UCS)
* Depth First Search (DFS)
* Depth Limited Search (DLS)
* Iterative Deepening Search (IDS)
* Bidirectional Search (BS)

uninformed-search-algorithm.py contains implementation of BFS, DFS, and UCS.
