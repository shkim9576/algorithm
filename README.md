# Algorithms
This repository includes a various algorithm implementations.

## Uninformed Search Algorithm
Uninformed Search Algorithm use only information available in the problem definition.
Examples includes below. 
* Breadth First Search (BFS)
* Uniform Cost Search (UCS)
* Depth First Search (DFS)
* Depth Limited Search (DLS)
* Iterative Deepening Search (IDS)
* Bidirectional Search (BS)

uninformed-search-algorithm.py contains implementation of BFS, DFS, and UCS.

## Constraint Satisfaciton Problem
constraint-satisfaction-problem.py is the implementation of Constraint Satisfaction Problem.
Goal is coloring each node with a color that is different from any of its adjacent nodes.
